If I shrink the screen size (992px, 768px, 320px) the website is responsive as the sizes of the image, text and all elements change to fit the screen size. The menu on the nav bar turns into a burger icon & hides the menu option. When the burger icon is clicked a dropdown appears with the menu link, then collapse back into burger when a menu option is selected.

On the about page if the screen is shrunk, the 'Who we are', 'Meet us here' and 'Newsletter' sections stack up as the screen will no longer be wide enough to display the elements side by side.
